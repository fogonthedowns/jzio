California is an expensive place to live. I knew that coming in to this state. But I did not fully appreciate this fact until trying to build something here. Larry Page once said Million dollar houses in Silicon Valley should only cost $50,000:

>"Even more than technology, he puts this down to policy changes needed to make land more readily available for construction. Rather than exceeding $1m, there's no reason why the median home in Palo Alto, in the heart of Silicon Valley, shouldn't cost $50,000." - [Larry Page][1]

Searching on Zillow, I came across an incredible deal. A near ocean front parcel of land, less than 20 miles from San Francisco for 12 thousand dollars. Determined to learn the back story and if any glimmer of hope existed I picked up the phone to talk with the Realtor to learn more about this land.

The unfriendly Realtor told me that the land was owned by a "84 year old community member" and I should call the Bolinas Community Public Utility District for more information. I'll summarize a few weeks worth of research:

* The [BCPUD][bcpud] has been in an ["Water Shortage Emergency Condition"][res-173] for [47 years][47-years]
  * The [Bolinas Community Public Utility District][bcpud] is governed by a five-member Board of Directors who are elected by registered voters [4]
  * The [BCPUD][bcpud] directly or indirectly provides water, sewer, solid waste, drainage, and parks and recreation services within its boundaries [4]
* The parcel of Land has a tax liability because it is zoned by the County of Marin: C-RA-B2 "Coastal, Residential, Agricultural"
  * In 2017 Parcel [191-061-09][191] had a $840 annual tax liability
* The California Coastal Commission, The Marin County Planning Commission and the Marin County Board of Supervisors adopted an 89 page regulation called the [Bolinas Gridded Mesa Plan][plan] in 1984. Specific to this property, 2 important regulations stand out:
  * Policy LU-2: There shall be no residential development along the Mesa's major drainageways
  * Policy LU-4: There shall be no residential development on the Mesa in areas with restrictive soils where on-site sewage disposal systems ore found to foil

Each of these regulations not only prohibit construction but also restrict land use through chicken and egg situations. For example [Article III of the Marin County Site Planning and General Development Regulation][marin-regulation] explicitly prohibit camping without water and septic hookups.

This is a very small slice of California but represents an important example of the challenges for development. If an individual wishes to increase the supply of housing in this city, even on a parcel of land that is not restricted, they will have to deal with an unmotivated Government who have used a half centry old water emergency to stop development.
